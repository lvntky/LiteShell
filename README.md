LiteShell is a modern and small sized shell for Linux users.

## More About LiteShell 
While I'm reading the amazing tutorial of ![Write a Shell In C](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) of Stephen Brennan I decieded to implement this approach on rust-lang and build a tiny shell for Linux.

Rust is realesed in 2010 so it's quite new but gives as many opportunuties in system programming/low-level programming side.

SO basically this is a fun project, feel free to fork&PR or download and use/test it!

## Enviroment

LiteShell was build and tested in the Manjaro Linux x86_64 and Arch Linux x86_64.

## Installation

```bash

cargo package will be added soon.

```
